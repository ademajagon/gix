## Gix

**Gix** is an AI Git interface for developers who value clean history, faster workflows, and smarter collaboration.

While it started with intelligent commit message generation, Gix is evolving into a broader assistant — designed to help developers manage branches, generate PRs, split logical changes, and understand code history with the help of large language models.
